# Tribute to Mẹ 🌸

A heartfelt personal tribute web page created in memory of my beloved mother. This project is designed to express emotion, preserve memories, and showcase thoughtful design rooted in Vietnamese culture.

## 🌺 Purpose

This webpage serves as a digital memorial — a simple yet elegant space to reflect on the life and legacy of my mother. It was created as a front-end project to both honor her and to practice accessible, emotionally-driven UI/UX design.

- 💠 Responsive layout with centered content
- ✍️ Handwritten and nostalgic font styles for emotional tone
- 🎨 Clean, respectful visual design using soft colors and rounded elements
